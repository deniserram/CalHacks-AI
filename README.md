What it does
Our Ai-Powered Chrome extension acts a design companion for your websites, providing feedback on digital accessibility (WCAG), design principles, and user workflows (how users navigate the website)

We implemented three separate agents: our design agent, accessibility agent, and web analysis agent. It provides a live solution, creating an affordable Chrome extension. Download it, and it will give you live feedback on areas for improving your design. It's a design companion utilized by developers, designers, students, and many more. As a user designs their idea, this extension ensures that the design adheres to accessibility standards, design principles and requirements, and any specific goal or idea the user is aiming to achieve. Because this solution is implemented as an extension, it allows the user to automatically extract branding guidelines from existing websites, helping designers get inspiration, guidelines from deployed personal portfolios, and analyze competitor branding. This ensures that the user receives the best feedback on their design as fast as possible.

How we built it

Pixel Pal was built on two key components:
It was built on a combination of web languages such as Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Google's Gemini AI helped us refine our code for continuous improvement and was a great help in detecting and fixing any bugs.
